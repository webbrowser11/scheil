# The Scheil Programming Language

Unfinsihed.

# Compile the example
This is currently the only file I have used that works so once i finish the toolchain and add the .scf lang file, this issue will be gone and you will be able to compile a wide range of files, but for now live with it.

Anyways compile using 

`py scheil.py example.sc`

Then run with:

`example.exe`

Or:

`./example`
